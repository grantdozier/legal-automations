19 Q. How often did these security reviews take place?
20 A. Monthly, without exception. We took security very seriously.

--- Page 3 ---

21 Q. Were you responsible for approving security protocols for DataVault?
22 A. Yes, all major security decisions went through me for final approval.

23 Q. Did you approve the use of SHA-256 encryption for customer data?
24 A. Yes, I specifically selected SHA-256 as our encryption standard.

25 Q. Are you familiar with the security breach that occurred in March 2021?
26 A. I don't recall any specific breach in March 2021.

27 Q. Let me show you Exhibit 12, an email you sent on March 15, 2021. Do you recognize this email?
28 A. Yes, that appears to be my email.

29 Q. Can you read the subject line for the record?
30 A. "Urgent: DataVault Security Incident - Customer Data Exposed"

--- Page 4 ---

31 Q. Does this refresh your recollection about the March 2021 security incident?
32 A. Well, yes, I do remember now. There was an incident, but it was minor.

33 Q. In this email, you state that approximately 50,000 customer records were compromised. Is that correct?
34 A. Yes, that's what the initial assessment showed.

35 Q. Earlier you testified that you were never made aware of any security incidents involving DataVault. Was that testimony accurate?
36 A. I misspoke. What I meant was that I wasn't aware of any incidents that resulted in significant harm.

37 Q. But 50,000 compromised customer records would be considered significant, wouldn't it?
38 A. In hindsight, yes, it was significant.

39 Q. Let's go back to your testimony about security reviews. You said they took place monthly without exception, correct?
40 A. That's what I said, yes.

--- Page 5 ---

41 Q. Let me show you Exhibit 15, meeting minutes from the TechCorp board. Do you see the entry from August 2020?
42 A. Yes, I see it.

43 Q. It states, "Security reviews for DataVault suspended until Q1 2021 due to resource constraints." Is that accurate?
44 A. Well, yes, we did suspend formal reviews for a period of time.

45 Q. So your earlier testimony about monthly reviews "without exception" wasn't entirely accurate, was it?
46 A. I suppose the reviews were more sporadic during that period. I was thinking of our normal protocol.

47 Q. How long were the security reviews suspended?
48 A. I believe it was about four or five months.

49 Q. And during that time, were you still overseeing the DataVault project?
50 A. Yes, I maintained oversight of the project throughout.

--- Page 6 ---

51 Q. Did you have any involvement in responding to customer complaints about DataVault?
52 A. Not directly. Customer service handled those matters.

53 Q. Were you ever copied on emails regarding customer complaints about DataVault security?
54 A. I may have been copied on some emails, but I don't recall reviewing them in detail.

55 Q. Let me show you Exhibit 18, an email thread from February 2021. You're listed as a recipient. Do you see that?
56 A. Yes, I'm on the CC line.

57 Q. This email chain discusses multiple customers reporting unauthorized access to their accounts. Did you read these emails at the time?
58 A. I probably glanced at them, but I get hundreds of emails a day. I can't recall the specifics.

59 Q. The email specifically asks for your input on the security architecture. Do you see that request in the third email?
60 A. Yes, I see it now.

--- Page 7 ---

61 Q. Did you respond to that request?
62 A. I don't believe I responded directly, no.

63 Q. Why not, if it was a direct request for your technical expertise?
64 A. I was extremely busy at that time. I may have addressed it in a meeting instead.

65 Q. Do you have any records of addressing this issue in a meeting?
66 A. Not that I can find right now, but I'm confident we discussed it.

67 Q. Earlier you said you weren't involved in customer complaints. Now you're saying you may have addressed them in meetings. Which is it?
68 A. I meant I wasn't formally responsible for customer complaints. But as CTO, I would certainly discuss security issues that came up.

69 Q. Let's talk about your supervision of the development team. You said you managed about 50 engineers?
70 A. Yes, approximately 50 technical staff.

--- Page 8 ---

71 Q. Did that include the DataVault development team?
72 A. Yes, they were part of my organization.

73 Q. How closely did you supervise the day-to-day work on DataVault?
74 A. I had regular check-ins with the team leads, but I didn't micromanage the daily coding work.

75 Q. How often were these check-ins?
76 A. Weekly, usually on Mondays.

77 Q. Did you review the code that was being written for DataVault?
78 A. Not personally, no. We had senior developers who conducted code reviews.

79 Q. So you never personally reviewed any of the DataVault code?
80 A. That's not what I said. I reviewed the architecture and key modules, but not every line of code.

--- Page 9 ---

81 Q. Which key modules did you personally review?
82 A. The authentication system, the encryption layer, and the API gateway.

83 Q. When did you conduct these reviews?
84 A. Throughout the development process, probably 2019 through 2020.

85 Q. Did you find any issues during your reviews?
86 A. Minor issues that we addressed immediately. Nothing major.

87 Q. What would you consider a "major" issue?
88 A. Something that could lead to a data breach or system failure.

89 Q. And you're certain you found nothing that could lead to a data breach?
90 A. At the time, I didn't identify anything that I believed would lead to a breach.

--- Page 10 ---

91 Q. Are you familiar with the term "SQL injection vulnerability"?
92 A. Yes, it's a common security vulnerability in database-driven applications.

93 Q. Did you check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in DataVault?
94 A. Yes, we had automated scanning tools that checked for those.

95 Q. And did those tools find any SQL injection vulnerabilities?
96 A. I don't recall them finding any critical vulnerabilities.

97 Q. Let me show you Exhibit 22, a security scan report from October 2020. Do you recognize this document?
98 A. Yes, this appears to be one of our automated scan reports.

99 Q. On page 3, there are five SQL injection vulnerabilities marked as "High Risk." Do you see those?
100 A. Yes, I see them now.

--- Page 11 ---

101 Q. Were these vulnerabilities addressed?
102 A. I would assume they were addressed, yes. That's our standard protocol.

103 Q. But you don't have specific knowledge of whether they were fixed?
104 A. Not without reviewing our ticket tracking system.

105 Q. As CTO, wouldn't you want to verify that high-risk vulnerabilities were resolved?
106 A. In an ideal world, yes. But we had procedures in place. I trusted the team to follow them.

107 Q. So you approved the launch of DataVault without personally verifying that high-risk vulnerabilities were resolved?
108 A. The team assured me that all critical issues were addressed before launch.

109 Q. But you didn't personally verify it?
110 A. I relied on the reports from my team leads.

--- Page 12 ---

111 Q. Let's return to your role and responsibilities. You testified earlier that you oversee data security, correct?
112 A. Yes, that's one of my primary responsibilities.

113 Q. Would you say you were ultimately responsible for the security of DataVault?
114 A. I was responsible for establishing the security framework, yes.

115 Q. And implementing that framework?
116 A. My team was responsible for implementation under my direction.

117 Q. So if there were security failures in DataVault, wouldn't that fall under your area of responsibility?
118 A. In a general sense, yes, but security is a shared responsibility across the organization.

119 Q. But as CTO overseeing all technology operations and data security, the buck stops with you, doesn't it?
120 A. I suppose you could say that.
